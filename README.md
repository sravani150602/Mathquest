## Overview
__MathQuest__ is an online learning management system designed specifically to deliver math courses and curriculum in an asynchronous format, allowing students to learn at their own pace. It provides capabilities for instructors to create course offerings, design quizzes and assignments, grade student work automatically, facilitate text discussions, and continually update course content, while students can browse courses, register, take assessments, participate in discussions with classmates, and track their progress. The system architecture employs a combination of MVC, client-server, and microservices patterns to enable a scalable, extensible, and modular platform that can handle multiple concurrent users.

## Development Setup

You need to clone (download) the repository to your local machine using the below command in the terminal
```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/ris-tlp/mathquest.git
```
> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine

  Once you have cloned the `mathquest` repository in Github, move to that folder first using the change directory `cd` command on Linux/ Mac/ Windows
```bash
   $ cd mathquest
```

Then open the terminal inside `mathquest` folder and run the following command
```bash
   $ code .
```

The above command opens the project folder in Visual Studio Code which will be the IDE for Mathquest Development (Feel free to use the IDE of your choice)

Once you have downloaded the source code of MathQuest in your local, make sure `npm` and `node` are installed on your machine,
then follow the below part 1 and part 2 to start the `MathQuest` application in your development environment.

### Part 1
First, navigate to the `mathquest-client` folder 
```bash
   cd mathquest-client
```
Then, let us install the dependencies required on the client side of the Mathquest application.

```bash
   npm install
```
> The above command installs the dependencies mentioned in the `package-lock.json` file of `mathquest-client`

Now, we can start the application using the below command:
```bash
   npm run start
```

### Part 2
First, navigate to the `server` folder 
```bash
   cd server
```
Then, let us install the dependencies required on the server side of the Mathquest application.

```bash
   npm install
```
> The above command installs the dependencies mentioned in the `package-lock.json` file of `server`

Run the below command to start the mathquest `server`
```bash
   npm run dev
```

If everything is up and running, you should see the home page of `MathQuest` application running on `localhost`
